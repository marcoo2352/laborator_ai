#In this part I'll describe the Simpson paradox using  pyAgrum
#le probabilit√† a noi fornite sono le seguenti:
# #gender: [0.5, 0.5]
# drug|gender = male; (with, without): [0.25, 0.75] 
# drug|gender = female; (with, without): [0.75, 0.25] 
# result|gender  = male, drug = without; (sick, healed): [0.60, 0.40]
# result|gender  = male, drug = with; (sick, healed): [0.80, 0.20]
# result|gender  = female, drug = without; (sick, healed): [0.20, 0.80]
# result|gender  = female, drug = with; (sick, healed): [0.30, 0.70]
